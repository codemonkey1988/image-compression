# Image-compression
Adds image compression to TYPO3 by several compressors.
Images get compressed by a scheduler task and not on-the-fly. 

## Configuration
Add a TinyPNG API key to the extension configuration in the extension manager.
To start the compression, there is a scheduler task that has to be configured.
